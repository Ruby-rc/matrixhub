# JobServer Technical Design

## Goals

JobServer runs cron-scheduled or manually triggered background jobs without
blocking API requests. Model synchronization is the first use case; cleanup and
other jobs can reuse the same framework.

- Add each job type as an independent processor with its own concurrency and
  timeout limits.
- Persist and claim jobs in the database with compare-and-swap (CAS); no
  external queue is needed.
- Run with the API server to keep phase-one deployment simple.

## Delayed-job architecture

All processors use the same delayed-job pattern. The following diagram uses
`syncPolicy processor` as the example.

```

1. JobServer triggers the Sync Policy Processor at startup and on each tick.
2. The processor asks `SyncPolicyService` for policies that are due to run.
3. The service claims each policy by atomically advancing its `next_run_at`.
4. For every claimed policy, the service creates a Pending sync task for the
   next processor.

### Detailed sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Timer
  participant Processor
  participant Service
  participant Database

  Timer->>Processor: Poll
  Processor->>Service: Find due policies
  Service->>Database: Select due policy rows
  Database-->>Service: Candidates

  loop For each candidate
    Service->>Database: CAS advance next run time
    alt CAS succeeds
      Database-->>Service: Claimed
    else CAS fails
      Database-->>Service: Skipped
    end
  end

  Service-->>Processor: Claimed policies

  loop For each claimed policy
    Processor->>Service: Create Pending task
    Service->>Database: Insert Pending sync task
    Database-->>Service: Created
    Service-->>Processor: Done
  end

  Processor-->>Timer: Wait for next tick
```

The other processors reuse the same structure:

| Processor | Poll and claim | Execute |
|---|---|---|
| `syncPolicy` | Due `next_run_at`; CAS advances the schedule | Create a Pending task |
| `syncTask` | Pending task; CAS to Running | Generate Pending jobs |
| `syncJob` | Pending job; CAS to Running | Run Git synchronization |

Manual synchronization skips `syncPolicy` and creates a Pending task directly.

### Processing pipeline

**Three-stage pipeline:** policy scheduling, job generation, and transfer
execution can be tuned independently.

  Task["Sync Task Processor<br/>Generate jobs"]
  Job["Sync Job Processor<br/>Synchronize model"]

  Policy -->|"Pending sync task"| Task
  Task -->|"Pending sync jobs"| Job

  classDef processor fill:#EDE9FE,stroke:#7C3AED,stroke-width:2px,color:#2E1065,font-size:18px
  class Policy,Task,Job processor
```

## Configuration

JobServer settings and defaults are defined under
[`jobServer` in `values.yaml`](../../deploy/charts/matrixhub/values.yaml).

## Phase-one boundaries

- Run one JobServer-enabled API replica.
- CAS prevents duplicate claim winners but does not provide execution leases.
- Detected failures are recorded but not retried; abandoned work is not
  recovered.
- Cancellation and job logs are local to the API server process.
- Multi-replica recovery, shared logs, retry policies, and worker metrics are
  future improvements.
